# File-Wrapper-Command

Project contains a single python file that opens a file (programmatically) and allows you view, edit, search, and delete the file.

## Key Items
* [Python's Regex module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
* [Python's system arguments module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html)


## Installation
I'm assuming you have python3 installed. If not, then you can easily download it by following these videos: [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rx_JRkwAjY), [MAC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hGzGdRQeak)

1. Clone or download project
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fopineda/File-Wrapper-Command.git
    ```
That's all...


# Usage
1. Enter the project folder
    ```bash
    cd File-Wrapper-Command
    ```
2. Run the file's help documentation
    ```bash
    python3 FileClass.py -h
    ```
    It will display easy to follow documentation on how to run the file properly.

    Please see examples below for more help :)

    Also, the project has a dummy lorem.txt file so you can test the commands.
    If you wish to complete the operations on your own file just put it n the folder and replace "lorem.txt" with the path/name of your file.

    Enjoy ðŸ˜Š
